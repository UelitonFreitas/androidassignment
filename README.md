# Adyen Android Assignment

This repository contains the coding challenge for candidates applying for an Android role at Adyen.
It consists of two unrelated parts:

## 1. Cash Register
Your first task is to implement a cash register. See the `cashregister` module.

## 2. App
Your second task is to implement a small app using the Foursquare Places API. See the `app` module.

You can modify any piece of code in this repository.
General rule of thumb: quality over quantity.

### Considerations
- Was prioritized architecture in this project due time. So, the UI can be improved a lot :D
- Was Chosen MVVM architecture with user coses from clean architecture.
- You should put your Foursquare API in '/local.properties' in the project root.
